\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
\todo[inline,color=backcolour]{write conclusion}

By choosing this project, we tried to include as much knowledge from the provided 
courses as possible. Not only from this semester, but from previous ones as well.
We have also tried choosing a project theme that would have applicability in real 
life scenarios.
We have managed to do that to a certain extent. 

Due to different unforeseeable events during the development of this project, we 
needed to compromise to fit the time frame, but the main idea 
remained the same. 

Subsystems were developed and tested separately by the group members, either 
individually or in teams, but every member has got his say in each of the 
subsystems during the development phase.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing the report, we did not manage to have all the 
systems work together. However, having tested them individually, we have a strong 
belief that they will.
