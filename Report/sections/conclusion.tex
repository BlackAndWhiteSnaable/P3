\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
Based on the discussion in the previous chapter,
we conclude that the goal of researching pathfinding algorithms and their implementation on a microprocessor was met to great extend.

The previous discussion about efficiency shows,
that the topic is not researched completely in this report,
but gives pointers to where future research should be headed.

We initially set out to develop a system subdivided into smaller parts,
so we could better accomplish a project fitting real live scenarios.

This goal was met to our full satisfaction in the subsystems,
but due to unforeseeable events during the development of this project,
we needed to compromise on combining all subsystems together.

Subsystems were developed and tested separately by the group members,
either individually or in teams,
with every member having influence on each of the 
subsystems during the development phase.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing the report,
we did not manage to implement a full solution.
However, having tested all subsystems individually,
checking their outputs and inputs to fit the defined interfaces,
we have a strong belief that the system will work as a whole in the near future.

All together we would say that the research going into this report was successful,
giving the authors and hopefully readers better knowledge about pathfinding and microprocessors.
