\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
\todo[inline,color=backcolour]{write conclusion}

By choosing this project, we tried to include as much knowledge from the provided 
courses as possible. Not only from this semester, but from previous ones as well.
We have also tried choosing a project theme that would have applicability in real 
life scenarios.

Due to different unforeseeable events during the development of this project,
we needed to compromise to fit the time frame,
and are happy with the achieved results.

Subsystems were developed and tested separately by the group members,
either individually or in teams,
with every member having influence on each of the 
subsystems during the development phase.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing the report,
we did not manage to implement a full solution.
However, having tested all subsystems individually,
checking their outputs and inputs to fit to the defined interfaces,
we have a strong belief that the system will work as a whole in the near      future.
