\chapter{Inverter}\label{ch:inverter}
After looking at different schematics for the inverter we decided to have a closer look at the H-bridge model.
We chose this model because it seemed to fit our knowledge level of electrical engineering while still giving us the opportunity to learn on it.

For a schematic representation of the H-bridge please see figure ~\ref{fig:h-bridge}.
The general idea is to periodically invert the current flowing through the AC Load.
To achieve this the current has to flow either from `A' to `D' or from `B' to `C'.
