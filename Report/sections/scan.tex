\chapter{Scan}\label{ch:scan}
In an attempt to take it a step further, we decided to use IR
distance sensors. Initially, our robot is supposed to find the 
shortest path from A to B, on a map. 
In rescue situations, often, the map provided does not match the 
actual outline, possibly due to different events that altered
the outline, such as wall collapses, that might obstruct the
movement in a certain direction.

By using 8 IR sensors, we can detect changes in all directions 
the robot can move in. If a change is detected, this will be
accounted for in the maphandling code.
