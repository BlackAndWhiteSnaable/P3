\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
In this project we want to talk about inverters and charge controllers with the main focus of bettering our understanding of those. We chose those two components because they are commonly used together in solar power systems.

We expect the reader to have a basic understanding of batteries and solar panels, but will provide some information on those as well.

\section{Examples}
You can also have examples in your document such as in example~\ref{ex:simple_example}.
\begin{example}{An Example of an Example}
  \label{ex:simple_example}
  Here is an example with some math
  \begin{equation}
    0 = \exp(i\pi)+1\ .
  \end{equation}
  You can adjust the colour and the line width in the {\tt macros.tex} file.
\end{example}

\section{How Does Sections, Subsections, and Subsections Look?}
Well, like this
\subsection{This is a Subsection}
and this
\subsubsection{This is a Subsubsection}
and this.

\paragraph{A Paragraph}
You can also use paragraph titles which look like this.

\subparagraph{A Subparagraph} Moreover, you can also use subparagraph titles which look like this\todo{Is it possible to add a subsubparagraph?}. They have a small indentation as opposed to the paragraph titles.

\todo[inline,color=green]{I think that a summary of this exciting chapter should be added.}
